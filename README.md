# Movie Genre Prediction
With the rise of digitalization comes the need to automatically label the ever-increasing digital content. Nonetheless, most video content is still labelled manually by users using textual descriptors or tags. However, in the last decade, the rise of machine learning methods and their application in various problem areas has spanned across various research domains, including video labelling. Our goal in this project is to investigate current state-of- the-art methods and then create our own movie genre classification solutions using various machine learning models. Because movie plots are widely available and can be assigned to genres, they are an excellent starting point for research into automatic text classification. Using the plot of the movie, we performed single-label and multi-label movie trailer genre classification.
